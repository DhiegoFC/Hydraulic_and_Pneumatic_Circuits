# Step Diagram and Overlap

This lesson aims to demonstrate, simulate, and practice the Step Diagram without and with overlap, in both non-continuous and continuous modes.

## 1. Continuous Step Diagram (A+B+A-B-)

## 2. Step Diagram with Overlap (A+B+B-A-)
The sequencing inconsistency in "A+B+B-A-" is referred to as an overlap or interlock condition. Overlap occurs when one actuator should not begin its operation until another has reached a certain point. A trigger or interlock is often introduced to ensure that this overlap does not occur.
