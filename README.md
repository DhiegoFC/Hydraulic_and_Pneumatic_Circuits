Public Repository for ' Hydraulic and Pneumatic Circuits', a undergraduate course offered by the Department of Control and Automation Engineering at the State University of São Paulo (UNESP), Institute of Science and Technology, Sorocaba (ICTS).

### Objectives
* Teach the principles of hydraulic, pneumatic, and electropneumatic automation and their applications in the industry.
* Explore the main components of hydraulic, pneumatic, and electropneumatic systems and understand their functions.
* Instruct on how to simulate and design circuits for pneumatic and electropneumatic applications.
* Explain the role and functionality of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) in automation.
* Provide training on programming PLCs for controlling electropneumatic circuits.

## Evaluation
 Using the FESTO Workstation and FluidSim software, this course is designed to simulate and create pneumatic and electropneumatic circuits, allowing students to connect theoretical knowledge with pratical exercise. Throughout the course, all evaluations are conducted through pratical tasks using the FESTO workstation.
